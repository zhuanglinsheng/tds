   - [x] [bitarray.h](./include/tds/bitarray.h)
   - [ ] [nbitsarray.h](./include/tds/nbitsarray.h)
   - [x] [array.h](./include/tds/array.h)
   - [x] [arraylist.h](./include/tds/arraylist.h)
   - [x] [linkedlist.h](./include/tds/linkedlist.h)
   - [x] [deque.h](./include/tds/deque.h)
   - [x] [hashtbl.h](./include/tds/hashtbl.h)
   - [x] [stack_arr.h](./include/tds/stack_arr.h)
   - [ ] [stack_deq.h](./include/tds/stack_deq.h)
   - [ ] [queue_deq.h](./include/tds/queue_deq.h)
   - [ ] [queue_lst.h](./include/tds/queue_lst.h)
   - [ ] [stack_lst.h](./include/tds/stack_lst.h)
   - [ ] [avltree.h](./include/tds/avltree.h)
